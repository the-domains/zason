<p>It is unfortunate that I start this site with a post about Black Desert Online. You see, for me, this game was to be "it." After the disappointment of ArcheAge and Trion's money-grubbin' ways I decided to avoid an MMORPG with a heavy CashShop and unforgiving RNG.</p><p>As a branch leader for a roleplay gaming community I wanted to find a game where we could both progress fairly and grow as a community. ArcheAge was, that at the beginning, a very good place to do this. At the time Toxa was leading <a href="http://eternus.enjin.com/">Eternus</a> in ArcheAge. We established a very nice IC town and there was many RP events and interesting stories being experienced. Later, Eternus opened its doors to other MMOs beginning with Final Fantasy XIV and Toxa took on a community management role and I took over the ArcheAge branch.</p><p>Eventually the RP community diminished until it was no longer sustainable. We decided to move onto Black Desert Online with the promise of no P2W mechanics. That aside, the game is not RP community friendly. It is very much a gear dependent PVP progression game and largely a solo experience because there is no player to player trading. The end game is gated by heavy RNG and massive grinding. What is worse, Daum / Kakao and Pearl Abyss have decided to take BDO to full Pay 2 Win. Kakao claimed to listen to their players is a lie because there is a massive outcry to not go forward with this change.</p><picture>

<p>This all began with their <a href="http://forum.blackdesertonline.com/index.php?/topic/106513-updated-in-game-accessibility-to-pearl-shop-items/">announcement to allow for cash shop items to be sold in the marketplace ingame</a>, basically allowed for those who wish to use cash to gain silver. One of the fundamental Pay2Win approaches. This was instantly met with negative feedback to this and a <a href="http://forum.blackdesertonline.com/index.php?/topic/106524-should-bdo-cash-shop-items-be-available-for-sale-to-other-players-for-in-game-silver/">poll was created to which at least 75% of the community who voted said no</a>.</p><p>They even edit their post from:</p><blockquote><p>As we have stressed in the past, your feedback is paramount to us, and that is still true. We encourage you to share your thoughts on this change as Pearl Abyss has requested. However, we ask that you do so in a non-abusive but constructive manner. We will continue to communicate on your behalf, and thank you in advance for your efforts.</p></blockquote><p>to...</p><blockquote><p>We are open to the community’s feedback and we encourage you to share your thoughts and concerns in a constructive manner on this change.</p></blockquote><p>...which further shows their lack of consideration for their customers.</p><p>Several videos and threads have appeared online with players talking about this change or announcing their leaving the game (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIuFymMM2ak">like this one</a>). Many are fairly popular content creators or streamers. There are even those who discuss the flaws of such an approach, rather than simply raging, like who Karmek posted an <a href="http://forum.blackdesertonline.com/index.php?/topic/107082-bdo-analysis-of-the-current-game-mechanics-and-how-p2w-would-affect-them/">analysis of the current game mechanics and how P2W would affect them</a>.</p><p>Daum/Kakao has been silent since this post which is not encouraging. In about 24 hours we will see after maintenance if these Pay To Win changes make it through (which they most likely will). Many have already left and more would follow. I, for one, will wait and see but most likely be leaving this game and Eternus will be closing it's BDO branch for good.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">The Swipe-agheddon is Upon Us</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
